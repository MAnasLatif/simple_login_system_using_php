# simple_login_system_using_php

You have to design a web application (using HTML, CSS &amp; Php) having features as described below:
When user open the website, the login page should be displayed to user where user can login to  your website using his/her account created on your web server(localhost). This page also has a  navbar menu for 3 other pages: Home, Signup, and AboutUS. If users try to navigate Home or  AboutUs page, the page should only be displayed to user if he is logged in to website otherwise,  he/she should be redirected to login page. For home page, you have to design it for any business e.g. for some food shop, a cloth brand, or  a mobile shop (as discussed in class room). You can choose any business and homepage will show  basic information of your business. Home page should contain the data with a good design e.g.  you should design the page using tools learned in CSS. Home page again, contains links to all  other 3 pages i.e. login, signup, and AboutUS.  SignUp page contains a form, where a user can create his/her profile. You should get at least 6  data items from user while creating an account. Email and password are mandatory fields.  About us page contains round images of two group members along with details. This page also  contains the contact details of your business as well as site address. You can also integrate the  Map here and it will be a plus point for you.
